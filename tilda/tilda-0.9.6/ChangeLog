	* Window Maker bug fix
	* Possible fix to Tilda not grabbing focus on pull down

	* Fixed a bug where the scrollbar would not show up on new tabs.
	* Fixed a bug where all new tabs in the same instance did not take on the
	  same properties as their parent.

	  them out!
	* Minor code cleanups.
	* Misc bugfixes.

	* Tabs have been added -- right cick on the tilda window to add or remove
	  a tab.
	* May have fixed some focus issues.
	* Fixed problem with GNU Screen.
	* Fixed gthread crash problem.
	* Misc bugfixes.

version 0.07 (2005-06-15):
	* New right-click menu -- you can configure tilda while it is running.
	  This works for everything but changing the key binding.
	* Removed the dependency on XBindKeys. Tilda now listens for key-presses
	  on it's own. See the README for details.
	* Removed support for commands of the form 'tilda -T $NUM'
	* Each instance of tilda now has it's own config file.
	* Misc bugfixes.

version 0.06 (2005-05-24):
	* New configuration wizard. Still ugly, and it still does not auto-update
	  yet, but I'm saving that for when you can have each tilda instance
	  configured seperately.
	* Fixed LOTS of possible (and real) buffer overflows. This fixes some GTK
	  crashes that we were having due to overwriting memory.
	* Changed the config file code around, it's much less hackish now.
	* Changed the way tilda is built.
	* Misc bugfixes.

version 0.05.1 (2005-03-25):
	* Fixed a defunct process that was running loose.

	* Added the environmental variable TILDA_NUM which is set to the current
	  tilda's number to move it up and down.
	* Fixed a bug where tilda would not clean up after itself 100%. Now each
	  time tilda is run it will check the tmp directory and clean it up if it
	  is not completely clean.

version 0.04 (2005-02-09):
	* Added support for running multiple instances of tilda at the same time.
	* Fixed a bug where tilda would close X when closing tilda.

	* Added many command-line options. Run 'tilda -h' to see them.
	* Removed the dependency on devilspie.

	  sure to run tilda -C if you are migrating from version 0.02 or earlier to
	  version 0.03.
	* Added fake transparency, option of black or white background color,
	  option of a scrollbar, and many more.

version 0.02 (2005-01-05):
	* Fixed bugs, hopefully, in writing to configuration files.
	* Added options in configuration wizard for devilspie and xbindkeys.
